Hey there, I am a generalist programmer with a passion for exploring the world around me. When I'm not coding, you can often find me with my nose buried in a good book, exploring a new city or hiking through the great outdoors. One of my favorite destinations is the Himalayas, where I have trekked through stunning landscapes and met some of the most amazing people.

On this site, you'll find a collection of my thoughts and experiences related to <a href="/tech">Programming</a>,  <a href="/travel">Travel</a>, and <a href="/other">Life</a> in general. I've divided my blog into these main categories to make it easy for you to explore the topics that interest you the most

So whether you're a fellow programmer, a fellow bookworm, or just someone who loves to explore the world, I hope you'll find something here that piques your interest. Thanks for visiting!
