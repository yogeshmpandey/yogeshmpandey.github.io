So, is it that time of the year again when the cold becomes a little warm and people like us decide to shrug the dust off our bagpacks. Yes it is.
This time me and a few collegues planned to visit many palaces in J&K around Vaishno Devi Temple.

**Thrusday: Starting**
It was my first trip to Jammu and Kashmir. Unlike other trips this one was well planned in advance. We started from new delhi railwat station and took the train to Jammu tawi. After a few quick games of UNO in the 3AC coach of the train we all went to our reaspective berths for the night sleep. 

**Friday: Vaishno Devi**

The train dropped us to the Jammu-Tawi Railway station at approximatly 6:30 am in the morning. After having some snacks and Morning Tea we boarded the bus to Katra. The bus crossed many Police check points and stopped at a local dhabha for breakfast. There I ate maggi after a long long time.
We reached katra and check in the Dormitory Rooms and rested for a few hours. Since it was my first visit I had no idea about the climb. It took time to realise that we have to cover approx 35 kms in hill on foot in one go. Well JAI MATA DI and we started. 

It was 5:30 in evening when we started the climb. The trek is not diffcult as the path is well build and there are a lot of people at any point of time. We reached ardhkumari (that is 6 kms from the start) in an hour as we decided to take the stairs insted of the trail. After having some snacks at the pitshop we again started to make way to bhavan. Bhavan is 6 kms from ardhkumari. The walk from here is pretty easy. We reached bahvan at around 11 am. Here we booked a room for refreshing. Then we went for the darshan. After darshan we proceeded to Bhairav mandir. It is said that the yatra is incomplete without visiting this temple. So we climbed 3 kms upwards did the darshan, and started coming down. We came 16 odd kilometers down at around 6 am in the morning. I had no idea that we had to walk 35+ kms in one night on the steepy slopes. One more item off the bucket list.

**Saturday: Patnitop**

After coming from the darshan, we rested for an hour followed by awkward leg massages. We then booked a traveller for Patnitop. After many checkposts we reached Patnitop. As we hopped out of the traveller snowfall happend, Happiness happened. After throwing our bags in the hotel room we came out to enjoy snowfall, and then it stopped. After exploring the place we went back to hotel. In the hotel all kind of mysterios stoies of ghosts, afterlife, aliens, weired theoris and many other things were shared. And after in the warm electric banket between fatigue isomania and horror fatigue won and i was in deep sleep. Forgetting that's its valentines already.

**Sunday: Nathatop**

Woke up lazily in the chilled room. Then after morning ritual we hopped in the traveller to go to Naag mandir. Here we ate hot halwa in the chilling weather. Dodging the local vendors trying to sell us "bulbul ka baccha" we reached the woodpainting shop. Here we made momentos to carry with us back to Delhi. From here we started moving to Nathatop crossing beautiful mustard step farms of the hills. There was a huge rush on the hills but somehow we found a isolated top with virgin snow. There we made first snowman and played with snow for a while. After capturing some snaps and admiring the beauty of kashmir we went back to our traveller. Later with the vivid memories of the trip we went back to Delhi.
