In the month of August, I planned to finish 2 books. So i bought these books that i thought would make a good read.

<a href="http://www.amazon.in/Think-Like-Zuck-Improbably-Zuckerberg/dp/007180949X">How to think like Zuck</a> :  This book is a sort of love letter with too much bashing of Mark. Though there are some of the things that were thought provoking. But overall it was boring. Filled up with meaningless so called success secrets. I lost this book in the mid ( literally), and hold no regrets.

<a href="http://www.amazon.in/Chanakya-Neeti-B-K-Chaturvedi/dp/8128400487"> Chankya Neeti</a>:  Previously  read Chankya's Chants by Ashwin Shaghi, and it kept me addicted till the last page. I always wanted to read the foundations on which this novel is scluptured upon i.e: Chanakya Neeti. Finally was able to get it from libarary.

> I strongly disagree. I do. Do I?

Now, Chanakya neeti is not for everyone especially not for feminists there are many shlokas that might be objectionable.Sometimes it looks that chanakya holds a strong grudge against half of world population. This book gives strong aphorism in a straightforwad manner.

Often one might smile after reading witty and funny observations that were derived from astute observation of great chankya.

Many Shlokas that my parents told me i found in this book.Everyone should read this book, clears the mind from many doubts and changes your way of thinking. Some things may not apply to real world but that is up to the reader to judge. Would surely read it again. Pure Gem.
