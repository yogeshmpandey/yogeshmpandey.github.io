Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.
â€“Vera Nazarian

Finished three Good Books in January:-

1. <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Feynmans-Rainbow-Search-Physics-Vintage/dp/0307946495">Feynman's Rainbow</a>: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life: This is a simple and sweet book. Initially, I thought that this book is about the life of Richard Feynman. But it is actually about the small but insightful talks author had with Feynman's in his last days and how it shaped his future and life. Good read worth the time.

2. <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Awakening-India-Swami-Vivekananda-Anurag/dp/9382894071">Awakening India</a>: This Book was was with me since college. One night I picked it up and read half of it in one sitting, Wonder why did I not picked it up before. I was intrigued, amazed and enlightened. Words hitting directly to your heart and soul. Learned a lot from this books about various aspects of Indian culture, Traditions and why things are the way they are in India and why it is good from the west. The book outlines what is wrong in India and how can we fix that. Will re-read again.

3.<a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B003TO5EF0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1"> Ayurvedic Healing, A Comprehensive Guide</a>: This book is an exhaustive introduction from the perspective of a western doctor on Ayurveda. It details on how three main elements vaat, pitth, khap (air, fire, water) and their proportion and balance in the body is responsible for a healthy being. It also has common ayurvedic cures for Injuries and Diseases. A good reference book.
