The hustle and bustle of Bangalore had me yearning for a getaway, and with a long weekend on the horizon, the perfect opportunity presented itself. Joining forces with a group of friends and my brother, we embarked on an unforgettable journey to the serene town of Udupi. Our adventure unfolded like a story, with an overnight train journey setting the stage for a weekend full of exploration and camaraderie.

Our journey kicked off with an enchanting overnight sleeper train to the quiet town of Murdeshwar. The rhythmic clatter of the train wheels echoed our excitement as we eagerly anticipated the adventures that awaited us.

Upon arrival, we freshened up at our chosen hotel and wasted no time in visiting the awe-inspiring Murdeshwar Temple. Nestled along the coast, this sacred site offered not only spiritual solace but also breathtaking views from its elevated vantage point. The vast expanse of the Arabian Sea stretched out before us, creating a picturesque backdrop to our spiritual retreat. We had our breakfast in the temple premises itself.

Taking a local bus, we made our way to Udupi, a town steeped in religious and cultural significance. Our accommodation at a nearby dharamshala provided a humble yet comfortable abode for our short stay.

We then headed to the nearby Malpe Beach, where the rhythmic waves and golden sands embraced us in a warm coastal embrace.

The second day of our escapade led us to Kaup Beach, where the sun kissed the shore in a spectacular display of hues. The Kaup Lighthouse stood tall, offering panoramic views of the coastline. Climbing to the top, we were rewarded with a breathtaking vista that etched the beauty of Udupi into our memories.
