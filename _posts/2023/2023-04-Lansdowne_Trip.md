Lansdowne is a small hill station, which is mostly popular as it the one nearest to Delhi NCR. Although we were told that it pales in comparison on Nainital but still we decided to visit Lansdowne. It was spring time and the morning wind still had some leftover chills as we started from Ramnagar. I realised that the USP of Lansdowne is that the road is straight till Kotdwar and the hill climb is for the last few kilometers, which makes it very easy and accessible. 

We reached Kotdwar and visited the Hanuman Temple. After the Darshan we started our climb to Lansdowne. I had booked the resort few kilometres before main city. The place was quite rustic and nice, it was surrounded by pine tress and the room had a nice valley view. Our rooms had a nice open balcony and the view of rhododendrons between pine trees made the stay more mesmerising.

After a peaceful night at the stay, we started our journey towards Tadkeshwar mahadev temple. The temple is few kilometres ahead of Lansdowne and is know for its peaceful ambience and tall deodar tress that engulf the temple. On our way to the temple, we saw Kedarnath and Chaukhumba ranges behind a veil of dust. I was happy, for it was the first Himalaya Darshan of the Year.

The temple itself is around 1 km downhill trek from the Parking. The pavement is well laid out and as you enter the premises, you are greeted with tall dense deodar trees that add to the mystic nature of the place. The temple is also famous for the Trishul like structure on one of the temple in the premises.

From the Temple, we went back to Ramnagar.
