A decade had passed since my last visit to Amritsar and Chandigarh, and as I returned, I found myself immersed once again in the rich tapestry of Punjabâ€™s culture and cuisine. This time, however, I had the pleasure of sharing the experience with my family, embarking on a trip that was replete with both challenges and delights.

Our journey began with an unexpected delay; our train, tardy by a staggering 24 hours, necessitated an impromptu sojourn in the retiring room. Eventually, when the train resumed its journey, it was halted just short of Amritsar due to a "rail roko" protest staged by the farmers. Undeterred, we hired a cab and, after a prolonged journey, finally arrived at our Airbnb in Amritsar the following day.

Our first day in Amritsar was a whirlwind of exploration, as we visited the hallowed grounds of Jallianwala Bagh and the serene precincts of the Golden Temple. The transformation that had swept through Amritsar since my last visit was palpable; the city now exuded an air of modernity and sophistication, its infrastructure standing as a testament to progress.

The following day, we journeyed to the Wagah Border, where we witnessed the spirited display of patriotism in the iconic flag-lowering ceremony. Later, we partook in the bhandara at the Golden Temple, savoring the communal feast amidst the tranquil ambiance of the temple precincts.

En route back from Amritsar, we made a brief stopover in Chandigarh, where we explored the whimsical charm of the Rock Garden and reveled in the serenity of Sukhna Lake.
