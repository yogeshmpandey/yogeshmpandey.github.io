In the start of the year, we planned for a family trip to Gujrat. After having the kid, this was one of the bigger trips in last couple of years. We planned to cover the Saurashtra region of Gujrat starting from Vadodara.

Since we had a 6 month old with us. It was very new and exciting for us to embark on this journey. We had to be extra careful and prepared in the Journey. Gone were the days where I could take the train and decide everything else next. This trip was planned like a clock work.

We started from Vadodara as our base, On the first day we went to Sardar Patel Statue using the Mumbai to Ekta Nagar Train. The first view of the statue were quite amazing and overwhelming. The place is well thought out and is unlike any other tourist place in India. After spending a day here we went back to the city and explored Vadodaa City exploring the places of interest.

After Vadodara, we took the overnight train to Veraval. Veraval is a city around 7 Kms away from Somnath. We took a hotel near the train station as our next train was on the same night to Dwarka. We visited Somnath temple and at the afternoon visited the Veraval beach. Veraval beach is quite an interesting beach, the beach is laid out with green moss carpet that is tricky but walkable.
