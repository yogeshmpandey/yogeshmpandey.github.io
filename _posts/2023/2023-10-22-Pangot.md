Yearning for a getaway from the mundane routine of working from home, a recent long weekend beckoned us to embark on a long-awaited adventure. Recalling an abandoned plan from years ago to explore the northern realms of Nainital towards Kilbury, Pangot, and Kunjkarak, the wanderlust ignited once more. This time, determined not to let life's other priorities derail our plans, we set forth with a band of friends converging in Ramnagar, brimming with anticipation for our expedition to Pangot.

Nestled merely 12 kilometers away from Nainital, Pangot unveils itself as a utopia for bird enthusiasts, promising a serene haven amidst nature's embrace. Initially considering a detour to China Peak, the allure of Pangot's myriad offerings swayed us to devote our entire trip to its exploration.

The journey from Ramnagar commenced in the wee hours of the morning, a tad daunting with a little one in tow, yet brimming with excitement. After a tiresome yet picturesque three-hour drive, we finally arrived at our sanctuary, Kaafal Resort, welcomed by the tranquil ambiance and a cacophony of avian melodies.

The subsequent day beckoned us to explore further, leading to a venture towards the hidden gem, a local waterfall mere kilometers from our abode. While there were numerous other attractions in Pangot, the proximity of the waterfall made it an irresistible choice, leaving us enraptured by nature's grandeur.
