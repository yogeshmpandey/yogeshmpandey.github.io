Second Last week of the year, the country wrapped itself in cold and frestive season. For some of us it was right time to escape, to add another experience, another journey, to seek new places, to wander, to learn, to live. With plenty of leaves this time we  planned to cover the Christmas markets of the nearby European countries.

The plan was to cover five Christmas Market starting from Munich, then Prague, then Budapest, to Bratislava and finally Vienna.

We started out journey in the night of 22nd March from the Munich ZOB station. We started early from the office and visited Marineplatz, at marineplatz one can find the biggest christmas market in Munich. The Market was jampacked with people. Everyone was busy buying items to decorate their houses, while some were enjoying gluewine in the slow snowfall. The Marineplaz church was flodded in the yellowish lights and snowfall in the midnight. After a few rounds of gluewine we headed towards the bus station.

Like always, we tried to get first two seats at the top floor, and like always, thry was already taken. Hoping for a better luck next time to myself and other friend we took the second seats and began our journey to other country.

From the bus stand we reached the
