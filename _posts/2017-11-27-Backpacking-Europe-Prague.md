Second Last week of the year, the country wrapped itself in cold and frestive season. For some of us it was right time to escape, to add another experince, another journey, to seek new places, to wander, to learn, to live. With plenty of leaves this time we  planned to cover the Christmas markets of the nearby European countries.

The plan was to cover five Christmas Market starting from Munich, then Prague, then Budapest, to Bratislava and finally Vienna.

We started out journey in the night of 22nd March from the Munich ZOB station.
