This Series is a part of [30 Days of Learning](https://www.notion.so/yogeshpandey/June-30-Days-of-Learning-65a60adfdd504eb2b989649fef13e6d2).

Interviewing is a skill. *Practise*

This course provides a sort of blueprint for the interview. You will need to dig deeper into individual topics. But still Its a nice refresher.

- Personal Characteristics 

  - Emotional Intelligence: Showing 
  - Intellectual maturity: Asking meaningful Questions. 
  - Curiosity:  The desire to know more. 
  - Perseverance: Ability to stick with something. 
  - Confidence: Ability in yourself to figure things out. 

- Non-Technical Skills

  - Problem solving: Use what you already know to achieve something specific.
  - Asking Good Questions: Asking the right questions to the right person. 
  - Understanding Assumptions: Not bring bais in the solution.
  - Understanding Constraints: Know beforehand the constraints of the system.
  - Collaboration: Skilled in listening and sharing your ideas. 

- Technical Skills

  - Collection
    - Compare and contrast collections about runtime, speed usage etc. 
    - Tupels , lists, dictionaries

  - Time Complexity
    - Big O complexity is asked mostly. 
    - Find the time complexity of the solution.
  
  - Recursion
    - An elegant method for solutions. 
    - Understand this concept clearly. 

  - OOPs 
    - Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

  - Data Structures
    - Very useful in coding challenges.
    - Stacks, Queues, Singly Doubly LinkedList
    - Non-Linear Data Structures, Tress, BST, graphs, hashmaps.
  
  - Sorting Algorithms
    - Try to implement sorting algorithms like Insertion, Quick, Merge sort, Bubble sorts etc. 
    - Learn about space-time complexity.

  - Searching Algorithms
    - Binary Search, BFS, DFS, A star.

  - Problem-solving framework for Coding
    - Variety and learning over Quantity.
    - Talk aloud
    - Write down the main parts of the challenge.
    - Write out inputs, output
    - Ask about assumptions and other queries. 
    - Write Pseudocode and run edge and test cases.
    - Then move to runtime.
    - It's ok to ask for help, "Am I headed in the right direction"

  - General Advice:
    - Apply before you are ready.
    - Failure is inevitable.
