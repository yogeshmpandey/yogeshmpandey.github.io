Munsyari, A place I wished to visit since I started developing interest in the Himalayas. The view of the mighty Panchachuli peaks was so fixated in me that I always tried to visit this beautiful city whenever I had a long weekend. But the plan always failed as reaching this little town is quite a journey in itself. Since we were on a 10 day trip in Kumaon starting from Nainital and staying and stopping wherever we wanted, Munsyari was the ultimate cherry on top of the trip. 

In our journey from Chaukori to Munsyari via Thal, we crossed beautiful pine forest and drove above the clouds as the valley below was covered in mist. On our way, we stopped at Birthi Falls and Kalamuni temple. Bithi falls is a beautiful waterfall to spend some time while on the way to Munsyari. Kalamuni temple sits on top of a hill. We saw our first ice patch and Panchachuli views from Kalamuni Temple.

Next day, we started on the feet to explore the city. Our first stop was Nanda Devi temple. The temple is situated around 2 km outside the city on a small hilltop on the side of the main road. The views from the temple were splendid that added more peace and calmness to the place. Then we walked from there to Tribal Heritage museum only to find out that the place was closed. On our way, we stopped at a quaint cafe (Alpine Glow Cafe) that provides probably the best coffee in Munysari.

In the next day, we spent some time basking in the crisp sun in the mountains sipping kadak chai, which is a feeling in itself. Our Hotel provided probably the best views of the Panchachuli, so we spend more time on the roof rather than the room of our hotel.
