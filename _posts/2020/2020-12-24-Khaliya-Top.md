Next and the last activity of our Kumaon Trip was to do the Khaliya top trek. Our cab dropped us to the starting point of the trail. Here we paid 20 INR per person as eco fees and started our journey. In the start we entered the dense oak forest that cleared after 2-3 kms and we were greeted with the beautiful views of Panchachuli and Rajrambha Peaks. The Trek is around 6-7 km one way with a breakpoint as TRH where one can say overnight and have some refreshments.

After around 4 kms from the base, we stopped for a tea break at the TRH. TRH provides fantastic views of the peaks and Munysari City. Khuliya top is only around 2 kms from here. After a tea break all our tiredness was gone as we did not stopped anywhere till the top. Till the top we had lot of fresh snow patches that made the trek more wholesome.

We were blessed to have the clear weather on the top. Our cameras could not stop clicking as the surrounding views were too captivating. From here the east side of Nanda Devi, backside of Trishul and nandkot, sunderdhunga and Milam valley were seen for the first time. We spend 2 hours on the top and reached back to the entry gate at around 4 pm.
