Currently I have some free time and subcriptions of many online learning platforms (LinkedIN Learning, Orielly, Udemy etc ) in my hand. So, I created this challenge for myself that I will complete a Online Course for each Day of June and write a blog post on my Learning.

I was able complete 22 days out of 30 days of learning. Below are the list of courses and the notes blogs for the same. There were some courses that helped me learn and know more about the tools and tech like Web Scraping and Python Web Apps. The courses on docker helped me refresh my knowledge. This was a fun experiment, I wished that I could have continued my streak.
