In the first week December I bought this book as someone recommended it to me. 10 minutes after picking up this book you might think what all in history could possibly come in 650 pages, but behold my friend this book is nectar of the human knowledge known to man at present (which could be arguably right or logically wrong). The book has 30 chapters covering everything from the Universe, planet and the improbable probability of human existence. Bill Bryson had spent painstakingly 3 years of his life to write this gem down to perfection. I hope i had read this before VIth standard. It has nothing beyond the curriculum of secondary student but the way the author has presented and deliberately kept the readers fixed to the pages by adding a tinge of secrecy, and whoa factor is just awesome.

In first five chapters you will probably face existential crisis by knowing that we are nothing more than a speck of dust in this entire universe. But also somethings in the book are complex and goes beyond human mind (at-least my mind). It is a very engaging read and more importantly, it acknowledges its limitations and also the limitations of the facts contained in it.

Some quotes from the book that are truly delightful :

>" Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stranded, stuck fast, untimely wounded, or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment in order to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result -- eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly -- in you "

>"Protons give an atom its identity, electrons its personality."

>“There are three stages in scientific discovery. First, people deny that it is true, then they deny that it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.”

>“The upshot of all this is that we live in a universe whose age we can't quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances we don't altogether know, filled with matter we can't identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don’t truly understand.”

>“The number of people on whose cooperative efforts your eventual existence depends has risen to approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is several thousand times the total number of people who have ever lived.”

>“It is a slightly arresting notion that if you were to pick yourself apart with tweezers, one atom at a time, you would produce a mound of fine atomic dust, none of which had ever been alive but all of which had once been you.”

In short its an excellent book, You can enjoy reading it. So much of science information in one book in the end you will feel like a genius.
Wherever you turn you correlate what you see with what you had read in this book. I had this effect.

If you are interested in science, you should try this. You wont regret buying it.(:
