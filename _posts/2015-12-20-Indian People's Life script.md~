**Indian People's Life script.**

Study in a good school possibly a Convent.

Get best marks and go to best college, possibly engineering.

Get a job with the highest pay or most security. Doesn't matter if it destroys your soul or is unethical practices.

Once you have job and few years experience get married to a girl from same caste / creed. Ensure she is slim, wheatish completion and possibly earns money. Just because everyone else is.

Have a kid within an year of shaadi. Or else the question about "khushkhabri kab sunaaoge" will start.

Get promoted every 3 years or get ready to answer "ab tak wahi kaam kar rahe ho?"

Buy a huge apartment with huge loan (at least 20x annual income).

Have more kids.

Go to shitty touristy traps and spend tons of money.

Get BP / sugar. Start having medicines to control them.

Get older and older. Now kids are going to "good school" and have become brats.

Pay money for kid to go to a "best college".

Let the kid get married

Die

That's it.

Note there is zero mention of exercise, soul searching, travelling as a passion, hobbies, philanthropy/ social service.
