I have been thinking a lot lately. Call it existential crisis that everyone experiences atleast once in their life. I was wondering what actually matters in life. And these were the things that came up in the order of priority:- 

1. Family: 

2. Health:

3. Passion:

4. People: 

5. Money: By this I don't mean being filthy rich like living in villas and bathing in champain. One should be satisfied be what he is getting in the end of the month given the fact that above things are on check. One should have a minimal capital to support himself for a period of 6 months (call it emergency fund). He/She should have finacial knowlege. Should think of Personal finanace and Financial Independece. Both of the things we as indians are unaware of.
