Taj-Mahal, a place that I had not visited purposefully since the time immemorial due to a special reason. But this year the reason was with me so I planned a trip to Agra. Finally to view Taj Mahal in person.

There are several itineraries on the internet for the trip so I won't be writing about the itinerary. Here are some pictures that I clicked as the journey progressed.
