This year I am not reading that much as I did in the previous year but still trying to cover good books. In this month managed to read three books. Small review of them is as follows:
 
1. The Lean Startup (Eric Ries) : This is a great book to read if you are interested in getting into the startup industry. If you have even a kernel of an idea, or just want to jump in and be part of a startup, this is a must read.

2. Getting Started with Raspberry Pi(Matt Richardson, Shawn Wallace) : Gives a good overview of the different things you can do with the Pi. Most importantly very inexpensive book.

3. One Minute Manager : This is a great little introduction to personnel management. This smart little book is easy to read and goes straight to the point. As its title suggests, it can be read quickly and you'll be able to benefit from its teaching right away, which makes it a good example in itself for a book on time management and productivity.

Also bought a kindle to read more. :D
