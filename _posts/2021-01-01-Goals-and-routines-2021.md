Every year I try to create some goals for myself and they fade out as life happens. But this year is different, this year I am publishing my goals public, making myself more accountable. 

These goals are based on [OKR](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) approach I will review these goals every three months and provide an update on the same. Be fitter, happier and more productive.
