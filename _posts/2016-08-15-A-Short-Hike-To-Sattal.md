It was about three months that I had only gone to and fro my home in the name of travelling. After a series of changing plans for finding the best places to go in this monsoon season and other unfortunate events we decided to to give Parashar lake in Himachal a try. But again the stars had something else in mind that got us landed in Sattal. 

Sattal is an interconnected group of seven freshwater lakes situated near Bhimtal. We reached Haldwani three hours late as the bus tire got puntured near Joya. Since, it was a trip planned in frenzy, After reaching Haldwani, We decided to stop the bus somewhere before Bhimtal and take the hill route till Sattal. But  the driver told us that it will be a long path and we should better take the vehicles from Meheragaon. However Google Maps showed a path relatively shorter and doable on foot. I had confidence in my insticts so I asked the Driver to drop us at that point and luckily we were at the spot from where Sattal was only 5 kms away. Thanking our stars, we started the walk. 

Initialy there were Houses on the way, which cleared the way to dense oak and pine trees. The locals helped us with the diverging paths. And after half an hour we found outself outside a church. A church between hills and Forest looked like a scene from a Fairytale book. We resumed our walk and reached Nal-Damyanti Tal. 

Somewhere in between it started raining. After rains everyhting became better, the trees became more greener, the smell of flowers became more vibrant, the songs of birds became more clearer and the void inside starts to fill in. We reached Sattal at around 2 pm.

We sat alongside the lake for a while and had Yummy maggy. There were many monkeys and ducks beside the lake . We went to KMVN after it grew darker. The room were quite nice. At this time of the season there was noone except us. Which was quite scary, but we slept peacefully. 

In the morning we had a heavy breakfast and started the hike back to Bhimtal. After Reaching home I figured out that we had missed some nice places like Subhash dhara which are a short hike from Sattal.

Other than regular sight seeing activities like boating and Paragliding can also be enjoyed at the lakes. Sattal is an ideal destination for a weekend gateway if you are in and around Delhi.
