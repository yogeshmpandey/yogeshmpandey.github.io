Goa was on my bucket list from a long long time. Even before the Inception of this blog, even before travel became a part of my life and even before I realised what travel does to a person.

So we a group of 6 people friends cum colleagues, decided to go to Goa in the month of February.Like every Goa plan, the plan kept on postponing till the month of April. Luckily we were able to get the cheap tickets to Goa.

My flight to goa was at 11 pm. It dropped me in Panaji Airport at around 1:30 in the night. To my amazement, there is no Uber/Ola in Goa. So I had to take the taxi all the way to Baga Beach. The cost of taxi came to be around 1600 rupees, this wiped out all the hard work done for getting cheap tickets. The weather of goa was little humid with a tinge of saltiness. As I reached the beach, the friends were already soaked in the colours of Goa, and I wasted no time.

Next Day I woke up early and walked from one end of Calangute beach to Baga beach. In the morning the atmosphere and the vibe were completely different. When everyone was well awake, we rented three Activas and visited Agora fort, Chapora fort, Vagator Beach, Anjuna 
Beach.

The view of the sea and the backwaters from Chapora fort is amazing. We tried a lot but didn't got the Dil Chahta hai feeling. Next we went to Mambo's and it was my first experience at some Clubs. I must say that it was an experience of its own kind. In the long night, we stayed at Baga, doing nothing.

Everyone was Well exhausted from yesterday's fun. We decided to try Parasailing and went to Baga again. this time the beach was filled with tourists. Parasailing was an amazing experience, but it didn't last very long.In the evening we decided to go to the market to buy some mementoes back. The so-called flea market is not so cheap. The best thing was live band performance in the middle of the market, not anything that you see everyday.

The last day we decided to visit Colva Beach. Colva beach is the longest beach in Goa. We walked from Colva to Beanulim beach. The beach was no less crowded than Baga but definatly cleaner and calmer. The sunset from the beach was absolutly mesmerisings.

Capturing all the experiences in our souls and cameras we bid goodbye to goa. With a promise of meeting again.
