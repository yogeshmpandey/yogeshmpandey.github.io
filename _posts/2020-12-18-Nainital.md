In the last month of 2020, we traveled to Kumaon starting from Nainital, in our way we stumbled upon a spot from where the Himalyan peaks were clearly visible due to the clear weather. Later when we stopped there we can to know that it was Himalaya Darshan spot. If you are coming to Nainital, do visit this place, it is a good place to enjoy the solitude of nature and enjoy the beautiful vistas.
