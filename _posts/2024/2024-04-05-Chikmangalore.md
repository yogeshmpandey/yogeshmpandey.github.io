Venturing out from Bangalore, where the scorching heat felt unrelenting, a weekend escape to the refreshing climes of Chikmagalur became an irresistible prospect. The promise of cooler temperatures and verdant landscapes beckoned, making it an obvious choice for a brief respite from the sweltering urban furnace.

Arriving in Chikmagalur, we were greeted with a warmth that transcended the weather. However, the initial day of our trip was hindered by the heat, thwarting our plans to explore the outdoors.
