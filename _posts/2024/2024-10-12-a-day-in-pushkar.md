Pushkar was the last stop on our Mewar trip. After reaching Ajmer from Udaipur on the Vande Bharat Express, we took a cab directly to our stay at the RTDC in Pushkar. The Pushkar RTDC is a unique heritage property, once a guest house of the Mewar Maharaja. As we arrived, we were struck by its surreal ambiance; one of its gates used to open directly to Pushkar Lake, though it is now closed.

After freshening up, we spent the day exploring the city and its famous temples. The highlight was the Brahma Temple—one of a kind, as it’s the only Brahma temple in the world. Located near Pushkar Lake, it’s a must-visit for anyone coming to the city. Surprisingly, it wasn’t too crowded when we visited.

In the evening, we wandered around the lake, eventually treating ourselves to a special dessert, Malai Rabri, after dinner.

The next morning, we woke up early for a short hike to the Gayatri Mata Mandir. Pushkar is very walkable, which made reaching the temple straightforward and enjoyable. The city was coming to life with familiar morning routines—children heading to school, milkmen delivering milk, and vendors setting up for the day. After about 2 kilometers, the trail led us straight uphill through a peaceful desert forest filled with the melodic calls of peacocks.

At the temple summit, we were greeted with stunning views of Pushkar. Part of the city lay under a misty veil, while the surrounding hills stood clear in the morning light. From this vantage, we could also see the Pushkar Gurudwara, various lake views, and the distant Savitri Mata Temple. After soaking in the breathtaking panoramas, we made our way back, savoring our last moments in Pushkar before bidding farewell.
