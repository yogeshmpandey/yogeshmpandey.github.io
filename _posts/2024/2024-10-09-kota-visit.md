Starting our trip to the historic Mewar region, we chose Kota as the first stop, primarily because it’s directly accessible by train from my hometown. Originally planned for late 2023, this adventure had to be postponed due to unforeseen events. But with renewed enthusiasm, we finally set out—ready to explore the sights and sounds of Kota and beyond.

Kota might be famously associated with India’s coaching industry, especially popularized through recent OTT series. Yet, there’s so much more to this vibrant city than meets the eye. From hidden temples to scenic riverfronts, Kota offers a delightful mix of adventure and culture, waiting to be discovered.

Our first stop was Trikuta Mahadev Temple, a lesser-known gem that offers a surprising touch of adventure. This temple, reminiscent of the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage, provides a unique experience for those seeking spiritual peace with a side of thrill. If you’re ever in Kota, don’t miss this—it’s a true hidden treasure..

In the evening, we visited the Seven Wonders Park, a lively spot with replicas of the world’s seven wonders. The park is an ideal place to relax and enjoy with family and friends. Not far from here lies the famous Jagmandir Palace. With its regal charm and serene surroundings, it made for a pleasant, refreshing walk before we headed to our final evening destination.

To wrap up our first day, we headed to the newly developed Chambal Riverfront. The riverfront exudes a cultural vibe, showcasing Kota’s heritage with beautiful light displays and an impressive sound show. Whether you want to enjoy the serene views, witness the local culture, or simply relax by the river, the Chambal Riverfront has something for everyone.

The next day, we hit the road to Chittorgarh, driving along one of the best-maintained routes in Rajasthan. Along the way, we stopped at several iconic spots, each with its own charm.

Perched atop a hill, Garadia Mahadev Temple offers one of the most breathtaking views of the Chambal River. The panoramic scenery from here is absolutely mesmerizing, making it a must-visit for nature lovers and photographers alike.

We also visited the Menal Waterfall, a tranquil spot that is equally beautiful and serene. Our final stop before reaching Chittorgarh was the Niliya Mahadev Temple, another lovely, peaceful site steeped in history and spirituality.

Kota, with its blend of adventure, culture, and natural beauty, turned out to be far more than a pit stop. From the quiet corners of the temples to the bustling riverfront, the city left a mark on us—a reminder of Rajasthan’s diverse and enduring charm. This was just the beginning of our Mewar journey, and Kota set the tone with memories we’ll cherish for a long time.
