For as long as we could remember, a trip to the North East had been on our bucket list. This time, while returning from Bangalore, we seized the opportunity to plan our long-awaited journey to Assam and Meghalaya. With our little one in tow, meticulous planning was essential. Opting for this season was strategic; the weather promised minimal rains and ample sunshine, perfect for our adventure.

Our itinerary began with landing in Guwahati, the gateway to the North East. From there, our plan was to traverse to Shillong, making it our base camp for exploring the region. Guwahati, while not abundant in tourist attractions, offered glimpses of cultural heritage at the Kamakhya Temple and serene viewpoints like the Gandhi Mandapam. Despite not being a fan of the local Naga cuisine, the panoramic view of the city from the Mandapam was breathtaking, especially at dusk when the Brahmaputra River shimmered under the fading sun. However, ongoing construction dampened the experience slightly.

The following day, we embarked on a budget-friendly bus journey to Shillong, which provided a local experience unavailable through pricier cab options. Shillong welcomed us with its pristine charm, defying all expectations. Cleanliness, cool weather, and natural beauty characterized the city, creating an aesthetic ambiance unique to itself.

Our first day in Shillong was a relaxed affair, settling into our Airbnb and acclimatizing to the local transportation system, notably devoid of Uber but enriched with accessible local taxis, sparing us the hassles common in North India.

The subsequent day saw us venturing to Sohra, immersing ourselves in nature's wonders. We marveled at the panoramic vistas from the Valley View Point, sought solace at the Ramakrishna Mission Ashram, and stood awe-struck before the majestic Nohkalikai Falls, the second highest waterfall in India. Crossing the 150-meter-long bamboo bridge to reach Masamai Cave was an adventure in itself, offering a thrilling highlight to our day, albeit capped with the sight of the dry Seven Sisters Falls due to the season.

Our journey continued with a trip to Mawlynnong, renowned for its living root bridges, testaments to the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. These natural wonders not only showcased the indigenous flora but also underscored the profound cultural heritage of the region. As the day unfolded, we found ourselves at the tranquil Dawki River, bordering Bangladesh, though recent rains had left its crystal-clear waters somewhat murky.

Back in Delhi, laden with memories and local produce procured from Police Bazar and Bara Bazar, including aromatic turmeric, ginger, and spices, we reminisced about our enriching journey. A quick purchase of Assam tea from the airport served as a flavorful conclusion to our North-Eastern odyssey, leaving us yearning for more adventures in this enchanting corner of India.
