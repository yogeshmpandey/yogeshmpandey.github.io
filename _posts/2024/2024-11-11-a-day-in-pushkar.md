Pushkar was the last stop in our Mewar Trip. After Reaching Ajmer from Udaipur in the Vande Bharat express, we took a cab directly to out RTDC in Pushkar. The Pushkar RTDC is a unique Heritage property that was one a guest house of the Mewar Maharaja. After reaching the property it felt very surreal, One of the gates used to open directly to the Pushkar lake but was not closed.

After getting freshen up our day was spent exploring the city and the various temples in the city. The city is famous for its Brahma Temple, the only Brahma temple in the world. The temple is situated near the Pushkar lake and is a must visit for all the tourists. To our surprise there were very few devotees at the temple at that time.

After travelling around the lake and back, we stuffed ourself up with the special Malai Rabri after Dinner. Next morning we woke up early and went to a uphill short hike to Gayatri Mata Mandir. Pushkar is a very walkable city that helped in going to the temple top with much hassle. In the early morning the City was same like any other city, children dressed up for the school, milkman delivering the milk and etc etc. After walking some 2 kms, the path took a straight uphill route. The route was good, surrounded by melodious sound of peacocks in the desert forest.

The temple top provided an amazing view of the city. One part of the city was still covered in the mist and another part (the hilly part) was quite clear. After soaking up the views from the top, we went back and bid goodbye to Pushkar.
