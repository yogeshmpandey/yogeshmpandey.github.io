**Zero to One: Notes on Startups**, or How to Build the Future after a year of its release is still the number one bestseller on Amazon. This is required reading for all budding Entrepreneurs. Author's insights and advice are very useful for everyone, especially for the people in technology.

One thing on which the author focuses is to invent/do something that no one is doing. One of the most important thing that an entrepreneurs should ask himself is "what important truth do very few people agree with you on?" or its business equivalent- "what valuable company is nobody building?". There are two ways of making progress one is technology led and other is process led. And it is important to consider that when we have scarcest resources we should focus on technology path. When you create something unique that did not exist before, you are going from zero to one.
