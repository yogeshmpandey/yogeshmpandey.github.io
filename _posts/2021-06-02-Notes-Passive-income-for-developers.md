# Passive income for developers

Author's journey and his stories in building Passive Income Online as a Developer.
He has divided his journey into 3 main parts as below :

- Video Production

- Independent Consultant

- Miscellaneous

Here are the notes from the course that I took and thoroughly enjoyed. 

## Video Production

Whatever you learn you can create a video tutorial for them. This is the author's approach

### Udemy

- Make courses on the technology you like.
- Don't aim for perfection.
- Don't invest much in technology for video production. Good enough is fine.
- Author has horrible first courses.
- Consistency is the key. Enjoy the process.
- Have incremental progress.
- 23 courses and 57k ARR.
- Invest in this at weekends and early mornings.
- Find what are you good at not what you are passionate about.
- Great source if you are a good teacher.
- Need a lot of patience.

### LinkedIn Learning

- LinkedIn flies you to their place to record the videos, all born by LinkedIn. Recording in the soundproof room.
- 200 dollar MRR + 1000 USD one time.
- You can share licenses to LinkedIn.

### Plural Sight

- Estimated 30k ARR for a course.
- Author was not eligible for this platform but he gave insights.

### Skillshare

- Mainly has UI/UX, photoshop based courses, less market for programming courses.
- Income is based on watch time.
- Author has non-existent income on skillshare mainly due to the type of medium.

## Independent Consultant

You can work as an independent consultant for different projects

### Billing

Mostly based on US markets.

### Hourly billing

- Billing depends on the type of role you have and the project you are working on.
- When you grow up to a higher role even 150 USD per hour is a very high amount to charge on average. Hence, hourly pricing punishes you as you gain experience.
- With an hourly rate, you avoid tools and try the longer routes.

### Fixed Pricing

- Pricing for the individual  components
- Add contingency to the project. In case things go haywire.
- Scope creep: the client will start requesting many features on the components.
- Get concrete requirements for what we are building. (Ex: the app will run only in portrait mode).
- Get a legal agreement.
- Keep in mind you have to give multiple revisions. 2-3 revisions. If mote you can charge an hourly rate.

### Value pricing

- Depends on what kind of value you can provide to the company.
- You go to the company providing some value. You convince the customers.
- Need to create a solid plan and pitch.
- Doesn't really work with startups. As the value is not clearly defined.
- Book recommendation - Hourly billing is nuts.

### Legal things to consider

- Author shares his experience on different websites and company.
- Create an LLC. So they cannot come after your personal stuff.
- Use legal zoom website or any other services to file for LLC.
- Other stuff is specific to the USA.
- Be careful about the agreement, write and share the agreement beforehand. Many websites can help you to create agreements. (Shake.com)
- These websites provide many templates for your tasks and name.
- Ask for some money upfront and rest on a certain date. Don't tie it to a milestone.
- Keep the client at ease even after the project is completed. Positive approach. Solve bugs for free if it is a part of the feature.
- Don't take the out of bounds requests.

### Taxes

- There are a lot of things to consider.
- Author uses online tools for his taxation (similar to [cleartax.](http://cleartax.kn)in)
- Not much important as all info is based on US markets
