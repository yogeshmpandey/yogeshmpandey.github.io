My Next stop after Ho-chi-Minh was a fascinating blend of East and West, the capital city of Vietnam, Hanoi.

I checked into my Airbnb and the views of the city were mind-blowing from this place. To see the city on foot, I started my journey from the Opera House to Hoan Kiem lake. Lake in the Old Quarter. All the major shops, eateries and places to view are around this lake.

My first and last stop on this trip was the Tortoise Tower near the Hoan Kien Lake. There are a lot of souvenir shops nearby this area, you can get a lot of items ranging from bamboo artefacts to Vietnamese Silk from here. I also passed by St Joseph Cathedral, this Gothic architecture looked like a ghosted church to me, still very impressive.

This was a very quick evening walk in the city. I bought some souvenirs from the shops and went back to my Airbnb for a sound sleep before my long flight back to India.
