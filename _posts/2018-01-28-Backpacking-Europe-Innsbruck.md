Innsbruck is a colourful, picturesque city nestled in the Austrian Alps. Its biggest draw is its location. Innsbruck sits in a valley and is surrounded by enormous, snow-capped mountains. This is a city with endless views, Sitting between Germany and Italy in Austria. This is the place that gives Switzerland shame in terms of the Natural beauty.

On Saturday, I was bored and wanted to escape the slow life of our suburb in Munich, So I called my friend and the plan was in place for the next day for Innsbruck. The weather was sunny, a perfect day to visit the queen of Alps. We started in the morning and reached Innsbruck around 10 am.

The first thing everyone should do after reaching is to buy an Innsbruck card. This card covers a ride on the Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen cable car (as well as several others in the area), admission into all museums and tourist attractions, free transportation on buses, trams, and bicycles, and it even includes a free walking tour.

There are a series of cable cars that can whisk you to the top of the Nordkette Mountains for 360° views over the area. We visited the Helefekar Cable car and it was just Amazing. Actually, this climb from the car is divided into 3 parts. First Hermann Buhl Square to Nordkette cable car,  Nordkette cable to Seegrube. The third cable car, from Seegrube to Hafelekar Peak, takes you as high as you can go (2,300 meters). From here, you get panoramic views of the Alps.

Next, we stopped at Innsbruck Zoo. This Zoo is Europe’s highest (Alpine) Zoo alongside various viewing platforms. The guide claimed that when the church bells ring in Innsbruck, the wolves at the Alpine Zoo howl along in unison.

After the mountains, I grabbed some shots of the beautiful brightly coloured houses on the river with a backdrop of the mountain. The evening made the view more exotic.
