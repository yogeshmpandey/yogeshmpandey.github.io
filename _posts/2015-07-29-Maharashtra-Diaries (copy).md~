Dear brother,
Sometimes in life we encounter some situations when nothing seems to be true, when the mind and body gives up.

It's been less than a year since you left me. No one would have thought in their wildest nightmare that this demon could have slyly crept into our  family. I saw you fight everyday I met u . Things were not good nothing was working other than your spirit to fight. Unable to spend time in that moment is going to be the biggest regret of my life.

Everyday I remember millions of moments we shared together 

Alll the mischieves and stories we had created together. 

Your absence has gone through me,
Like thread through a needle.

Everything I do is stitched with its color.
