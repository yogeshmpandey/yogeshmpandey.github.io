Grew up +1 in numbers yesterday. Had a super awesome day. But this post is not about that. So while going through quora/reddit I came through thread that had the implementation of automatic replying to a birthday post on facebook. I tried to implement the same using facebook's graph api's. So first you need to get a token for your app to work from <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/"> here</a>. Add this token in the code ( it expires every 1 hour, so make sure the token is fresh). Second you need the epoch time of your Birthdate ie: [15-09-2015 = 1442275200] from any <a href="www.epochconverter.com">online epoch converter</a>. Then run this python script the next day. It auto replies and comments on each of the post from previous day
