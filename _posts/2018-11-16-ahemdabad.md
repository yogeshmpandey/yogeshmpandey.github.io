Life is full of surprises. I had been planning a Family Trip in the state of Gujrat.  And, all efforts to lure family for the 2-week trip were going down the drain. And lo and behold, Suddenly, I got this opportunity to visit the city during a business trip.

I had 2 days to visit the city. I planned to participate in the mandir to masjid heritage walk that is organized by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It starts at 7 AM at the Swaminarayan Temple and ends at Jama Masjid. But the next day, I woke up at 8 am, and all my hopes to participate in the walk. I didn't lose hope and stated solo on the walk since all the maps and details were mentioned in the Gujrat Tourism website.

I walked through various pols and old houses, the old designs were in place and were designed keeping in mind the architecture and religion.

Next step was the masterpiece of Siddi Sayyed ki Jaali. On the back of the mosque are four sets of delicate carvings on the wall. One of the carvings on the wall is the logo for IIM Ahmedabad.

Next stopover was Adalaj ni Vav. Intrigued to see that the place of this intricate carving and amazing architecture was a place to get water and for resting of the travellers crossing the area. It has 5 floors. As you walk down it gets darker and colder.

In was evening and in Google Maps, I saw that I was near Sabarmati Ashram. The Ashram is near the banks for river Sabarmati. It has all the things Gandhiji used while his stay in Ahmedabad, The ashram houses among many other things, handwritten letters exchanged between leaders of the world and Gandhiji.

Next Day, I visited the Hutheesing Jain Temple. Build in 1848, the cost back then for the temple was whooping 1 million dollars. Inside the temple, there are 52 small shrines, each housing an idol in exquisitely carved and polished marble of each of the Tirthankaras.

Later in the morning, I visited Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel museum and exhibition centre. It has various rooms depicting the various life events of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It is really well made in contrast to other museums in India.

Later in the evening, I visited Kankaria Lake. Kankaria lake is a manmade lake made in the 1400s. Now, it is the public attraction having a zoo, toy train, kids city, water rides, food stalls, and entertainment facilities. Interestingly, from the Maps, it looks like the logo of SBI bank.
