Every year I try to create some goals for myself and they fade out as life happens. But this year is different, this year I am publishing my goals public, making myself more accountable. These goals are based on [OKR](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) approach I will review these goals every three months and provide an update on the same. Be fitter, happier and more productive.

Quarter 1 Update [01-01-2021] to [31-03-2021] - _Done_

Quarter 2 Update [31-03-2021] to [31-06-2021] -

Quarter 3 Update [01-06-2021] to [31-09-2021] -

Quarter 4 Update [01-09-2021] to [31-12-2021] -


- Wake up before 6 am.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

I think I am failing miserably in this goal. I might have followed only 10% of this goal. The key to waking up early is sleeping early, which is something I am not able to do.

- Read 20 Books.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

Completed 4/20 books.

- Publish 20 Good Blogs.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

Completed 2/20, need to plan and catch up on this goal. Already have a few drafts to publish.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

Done, the above goal (which I think was the hardest) is luckily completed :).

- Podcast/Audiobooks every day.

*Quarter 1 Update :*
 I usually listen to Podcast/Audiobooks during my walks and runs. Often not every day but I am keeping up with this habit.

- Exercise every day.
  - Run a half Marathon
  - Cut back to 76 Kg, Gain Muscles.
  -  Stretching

*Quarter 1 Update :*

I am slowly progressing and building upon this habit. Although I get off track sometimes, I think I am gradually transitioning into a routine. Have lost 1.5 kgs.

- No Phone Sundays.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

Failing in this will try to keep in mind this goal.

- Meditate for 100 days this year.

*Quarter 1 Update :*

I incorporated this habit after my workout session but not able to fully follow this. Meditated only for 10 days.

- No personal buying (clothes, accessories, No Amazons, Flipkarts, Swiggys, Zomatos, Netflixes, Ubers)

*Quarter 1 Update :*

Did not buy anything online for me.
