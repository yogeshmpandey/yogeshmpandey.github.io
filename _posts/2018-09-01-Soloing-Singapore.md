In the month of August, i got an opportunity to visit Singapore for a week. Singapore is the second richest city-country Sandwiched between Malaysia and Indonesia.
Singapore is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world for a lot of reasons. It has skyscrapers and subways unique amalgamtion of Chinese, Malay and Indian people along with a tropical climate, tasty food from hawker centres and easy accessibity to the well known places. The only downside is that all the good places are very costly to visit.
In the planning phase of my trip, I read that Singapore was very walkable city. Which is not quite true but still I managed to cover Singapore by foot. Covering a county by foot is however not recommended.

I booked my Hostel named The Atlas Station in the outskirts of Little India suburb. It is an space themed Hostel which has spacepod esque rooms that are very good for privacy and have amazing aesthetics and cleanliness. At the night, I downloaded the local maps as my phone didn't had the signal.

Next Day early morning, I started my walk into the city. My goal for the day was to reach Gardens by the Bay. During my walk I strategically chose the path via which I can cover the majority of the places while reaching my destination. Crossing the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, Mustafa, Sultan Mosque I reached the Arabic Street. The street has a lot of shops selling arabic fabric to lamps and fragrances to food. There are many streets like these catering the needs of travelers and especially people from a particular ethnicity.

Suddenly it started raining very heavily. To be honest, in my entire life, I had never seen the weather change so drastically. I opened my Umbrella but I was certain that it will not save me from this heavy rain. So I took shelter in a nearby cafe. In around 20 Minutes the rain subsided and I follows the Google Maps to my destination. After crossing multiple sidewalks, I reached in middle of a forest, although according to maps I should be on a road, I wasn't. Hmmmmm, I said to myself. from this point I certainly cannot back and the way forward was not certain, on top of that the forest was full of mud puddles. Sometimes in life too, we face a situation like this, where you cannot go back and the path ahead is not certain. In the situations like these, the one thing that helps is faith, having faith in your journey and your goals. I re-establised my faith and started walking on the path. After 20 minutes I was at an underpass. I crossed the pass and was again on a sidewalk.

From this side-walk I reach the F1 Singapore Grand Prix stadium. From here the walk to the Marina bay sands is very easy. I reached the Marina Bay sands and was amazed by the magnanimity of the place. From the Marina Bay sands I went to Gardens by the Bay situated next to Marina Bay Sands. It is a large public garden which house two huge cooled conservatories â€“ the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest as well as a cluster of gigantic Super Trees. It is one of its kind garden in the world. The flora, fauna and the ecosystem literally blew my mind. Ticket to both the places costs $28. But
