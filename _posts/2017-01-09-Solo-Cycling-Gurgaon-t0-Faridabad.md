The greatest take away from the journey was that not all stories are going to end the way you want, that there are things in life that you cannot control—and that’s okay.

It was the first weekend of the year. I woke up at around 6am. It was Raining Outside and temperature was very low.
Kareri lake trek starts from Kareri Village. Regular buses ply from Dharamshala to Ghera. From Ghera one needs a Taxi to Kareri village.
