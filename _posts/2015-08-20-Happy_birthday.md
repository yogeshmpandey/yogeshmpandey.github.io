Today i would have been celebrating my brother's 22nd birthday. I want to write so many things, all those beautiful memories of our childhood that morphed into what i am today. But i suppose this is not a platform to do so.
This will go in the diary.

However and excerpt   


>Your absence has gone through me,  
>Like thread through a needle   
>Everything I do is stitched with its color.   
> 
>All these regrets, rips my soul apart   
>Circling our souls and lives in one another,   
>but still i hold, a deep commune in my heart    
> 
>A man so strong like you, i will never find other,  
>wherever you are happy birthday, dear brother  

- First stanza : "seperation" by W. S. Merwin
