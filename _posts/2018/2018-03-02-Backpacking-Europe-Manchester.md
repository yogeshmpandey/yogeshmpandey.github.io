It was  evening in Liverpool and I was waiting for my bus to London. After waiting for an hour, I received a message that the bus had been cancelled. There were no trains back to Manchester and I had no place to spend the night. Gloomy and sad I went to the MacDonald and ordered a big coffee to keep me awake for the night. I Opened the AirBnB app and there was no cheap accommodation available nearby. I decided to stay at the Macdonald for the night and start early morning back to Manchester. I took early morning train and booked an AirBnB while on the train. After reaching the AirBnB, I slept for the entire Day, Next Day I left the Airbnb and went to explore the city.

In the morning, it was drizzling a bit but still, I started the tour of the city, First stop was Alan Turing Garden. The Garden is nothing fancy but a small life-size figure of Alan Turing sitting on a chair with an apple.

One of my friends who already had been to Manchester told me to visit the Museum of science and industry. So  I walked towards the Museum crossing Manchester Town hall, Beetham Towers, Chinatown and other Big buildings. Every architecture amazed me about its historic relevance and Grand architecture.

The Museum of Science and Technology is one of kind Museum devoted to the development of science, technology and industry with the focus on achievement and contribution of the city in these areas. For me, the main attractions were the Aircraft section with  Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, Hawker Hunter, Superman Spitfire and the replica of the Manchester Baby [One of the first computers].
