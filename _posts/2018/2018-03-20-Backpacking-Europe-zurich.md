> Morning View of Munich ZOB

These were my last few days of me in Europe, add all my friends had told me to visit Switzerland at least once before I came back.  Initially, I didn't wanted to go to Switzerland as it is the costliest country in the world. But, anyways since I had already covered a major portion of Europe and Switzerland was the last country that was left, I started to plan to visit Switzerland. The plan was to cover two cities of Switzerland, Zurich and Lucerne. I reached Munich ZOB to be at around 7 a.m. in the morning with my three other Friends and the journey started around 7:30. The bus took around 3 hours to reach Zurich.

The one thing that stood out just as we stepped in Zurich was that the city was very clean unlike cites like Paris and Belin,  The roads were wilder and cleaner. Since it is generally is the first place where tourists arrive, it is often referred to as the "portal to the Alps".

It was a quick Day trip to the City, We walked and covered the Major Attractions including Grossm√ºnster, Old Town, St Peter's Church and many others
