**Everyday**

The numbers of

>‘You will die in obscurity’   
>are amplified by my mind    
>daily daily daily,    
>but my heart says    
>"Who cares? Go on."    
>Is this what life is?    
>Up    
>and    
>down.    
>The beauty of life    
>and    
>the dilemma of living.    



**The Proposal**

I know that this doesn't sound cheesy
but you know ...
the road with me will obviously not be easy
coz I will ...
take you to hills, mountains and in the depth of seas
you will ...
always think of if time could freeze.
I promise ...
that i will love you with all my strength
whenever you're tired ...
I will hug you tightly, with my arm's length
as this poem ...
was just about to finish, I woke up
again i curled up in my bed ...
God please give me back this dream, I said in my head



**The Breakup**

the time has come to say goodbye
as they mutually decide to move on
to forget her with agony and despair
in the back of his mind, he knows she's still there.
because he has seen her from inside
he just can't understand her reason to hide 
he know that sometimes she cries
when tears of delusion rolls down her eyes
She is angry at herself or maybe him
questioning why the world is so grim
or maybe it is just what he thinks.
or maybe it is what it is.
He just want to stay free
help him out, unfuck him
As he can't go back to "us", and 
He can go back to "you" and "me"
