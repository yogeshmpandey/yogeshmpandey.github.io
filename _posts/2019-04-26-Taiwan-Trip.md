In the last week of March, I got an opportunity to visit Taiwan, a small independent island near China or an extension of China. A beautiful developed small city with a lot to offer in terms of travelling, eating and general sight seeing. It was 35 degrees warm as I boarded the flight to Taiwan via Hong Kong from Delhi. As I landed in Taipei, I was greeted with a humid and cold weather. Since I didn't brought any jackets or umbrella, I rushed to a nearby 7-11 and grabbed an hot coffee and a fancy transparent Umbrella.
