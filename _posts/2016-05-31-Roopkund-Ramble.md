Its like Love, Maybe a long distance one, but it is. The inescapable desire, the deep obsession that leaves the traveller no other choice than to plan his next expedition back to - The Himalayas. This next expedition of ours was to Roopkund. Roopkund is a well known pristine high altitude galcial lake that lies in the lap of Trishul masiff in upper himlayas. It is well known for its mystic and spiritual essence. The trek has every delight for a tasteful trekker. It has Deep forests, splashing rivelts, breath-taking meadows, great campsites, snow and ice everything wrapped in a package as we climb from 8,000ft to 16,500ft in 5 days.

NOTE : This is a lenghty post. So put on those reading glasses, grab a popcorn and please for the sake of the super awesome pictures yet to come view in a big screen.

From the Local guides and the book that i was reading (The Nanda Devi Affair) while on the trip. I came across various myths associated with this trail.

* Lohajung is named after the deamon loha. Who was killed by Godess Durga or Nanda Devi on the same lands. 
* Lord Bramha wrote the four vedas near bedni kund in Bedni Bugyal.
* Gohralatauni a place further ahead. It is named so because from here the horses return back due of lack of pasturable lands and rocky paths.
* The king of kumaon took  a pilgrimage to Nanda devi with his dancers. This disrispect for the godess made her very angry and infuriated she cursed the dancers to become Stones. At patharnauchani we can see many big stones connected to the folklore.
* There is a temple of kaluvinyak at the end of steep climb after pathar nauchani. Legends has it that lord vinayak (Ganesha ) stood Gaurd as godess parvati was took bath at roopkund lake.
* At our last base camp to roopkund "Bhaguwabasa" Godess Parvati left the tiger for the bath.
* Legend says that while Lord Shiva and Godess parvati were on their way to kailash, Godess parvati felt thirsty. So Lord shiva with his trishul created the roopkund lake. It was here that the Godess parvati first saw herself(roop) in the crystal clear water of the lake. Hence it is named as RoopKund.
* Every 12 years a four horned ram is born in some village and  this marks the auspicios begennning the Nanda Devi Rajjat Yatra. This Yarta is done by thousand of villagers to pay offerings to Godess Nanda. The yatra ends in Homekund. The local undertake this harsh journey barefoot from bedni bugyal to Homekund. This Yatra unites both the Kumaoni and Garhwali communities of Uttarakhand.
* The biggest mystey is of over 500 skeletons in the lake. These is believed to be of the travellers who lost their way somehow. These skeletons dates back to  1000 AD. As the lake at the confluence of three ridges, someone falling from the ridge is most likely to fall in the lake. But local guides tell a different story. Once the king of Kanauj - Raja Jasdhawal undertook Raj Jat Yatra along with his wife. Who near roopkund gave birth to a child. Goddess Nandadevi considered it a sacrilege in her domain and sent down a hailstorm. Rajaâ€™s people were caught in it and perished in Roopkund. 

**Day 1 : Delhi to Kathgodam:**

Since Roopkund is a diffcult trek at this time of the season we decided to trek with TTH (TrekTheHimalays) Team from 19-May to 26-
may. Some of the collegues had previously trekked with the team with good reviews. My backpack was still unpacked with the stuff from the trek on the previous weekend. So i carelessly filled it with other warm clothes. It was later I realised that i had forgot may items like towel, soaps and other basic nut  important stuff. I reached Katgodam at around 8.00 pm and met my collegues.After eating a heavy pizza in the Dinner, slept at KMVN kathgodam.

**Day 2 : Kathgodam to Lohajung:**

We reached Kathgodam railway station and waited for other fellow trekkers to join the party. At 7.00 am our Cabs started a 10 hour long journey to lohajung. Our driver was an extrovet and jolly fellow that went by the name of mishraji. After crossing Bhimtal and bhowali we stopped at a cafe for breakfast. Crossing Garampani and almora somewhere after kausani we parked for lunch. Here, Kumaoni dishes like bhatt ke dubke and dal were mouth watering (Well !! atleast for me). The hotel provided the splendid views of the Garhwal and kumaon Himalayas, but in the afternoon's mist and smog nothing was visible. A few of us took a strool in the tea gardens at the hills on the other side of the road. Again we continude our journey and after a few hours stopped at a small brook. Esctacy was felt in the viens as we dipped our feets in the cold water of the brook. Journey continued after we took selfies and photographs. The condtion of the roads became worse as we moved from kumaon to garhwal. As Garhwal lies in higher mountains, it is more prone to landslides and other conditions which makes the roads more tattered - told mishraji . As we crossed gwaldham Mishraji told us many stories about the myth associated with the villages. He showed us the tree which has five differnt species of tree and the meadow where no rice or wheat can grow after being cused by Goddess Nanda. He told us the route we are following is the same for going to badrinath and Rajjat yatra which is held once in every 12 years.


After a long break at deval which helped me fetch those basic utilites, we reached loharjung at around 5 pm. Mishraji told us about the story after the naming of the place as lohajung. It is very surprising and intriuging that how these small stories are connected with each other. Every village here has shared some part in these stories, the kids are told these stories before they learn basic alphabets. This makes one question the facts and the fiction part of the story.

Later in the evening we had our first briefing. There we came to know about our trek leader Mr Gopal Kishan who was a young guy from kullu. He had his own ways of saying things but also a good sense of humor. We came to know that we were 25 people from all walks of life doctors, enginners, students and others. After a light know how, dinner and quick game of UNO we went to sleep.


**Day 3: Lohajung to Didna Village:**

After 6-7-8 routine, which meant tea at 6 am breakfast at 7 and Leaving the camp at at 8. The trek started to Didana Village. Our team of 25 was joined by two other local trek guides. These two were well versed by the mood of their mountains. Initially the trek was a gradual descent till Neelganga river. After that we faced a steep ascent from here it is 2 hours climb to the village. Our guide chanted "Mathu maath, Pahad Path" meaning only slowly slowly the mountians can be travelled. At Around 1 pm homestay at Didana village welcomed us with Refershing drink made from Buransh flower. In the evening the blue sky grew darker and the it started raining. The evening transended to night after some chit-chats, storytelling and Dumb Charades.

**Day 4: Didna Village to Ali Bugyal:**

After the same 6-7-8 routine we started the trek from Didna village. Didna was our last contact with civlization. The trek in starting seemed easy with moderate ascent but after an hour or so it felt like rock climbing. We refilled our bottles from Tolpani. In the last strech to the meadows our bodies were very tired. At around 12 am the oak forest around us magically ended and we found ourself on a yelloish green carpet of grassland that stretched to many kilometers. We had reached Ali Bugyal. Here we had our lunch that was packed from didna village. Sheeps and horses grazing on the stunning backdrop of the mounatins felt like a scenery from an art book. Somewhere here we were joined by billu our loyal companion for the rest of the trek. It was the first time we saw a tree line, the edge of habitat above which no tree grows due to altitude. This can be called AMS (Acute mountain sickness) for Trees. We descended from Ali Bugyal to our Base camps. With altitude gain we had a heavy head. Fear of AMS started to build up on the rear.

Our campsite was situated in front of a stunning view of Trishul, Nandaghunghti and Maiktoli peak. It was the first time I was viewing these peaks with such clarity and closeness. Tea and Hot parkoras in the evening made everything more enticing. It was a grand experience, little did I knew, this experience was going to get so much better tommorow. In the evening on the command of our trek leader we started our hunt for dry wood for our campfire in the forest. We came back with pretty  impressive collection. After the Dinner a local gut told us about all the mythological stories surrounding the places during the trek. Later Team played Antakshari alongside the campfire. Outside the tents we overheared people singing their local songs. Thinking of my limited kuamoni song library in my mind, i lost myself in another game of UNO. 

There is scarcity of resources in Ali Bugyal and many other places. The support staff had to work very hard to keep the expediton running.  Their hard work in these hostile climate gives you a feeing of guilt. Kudoes to them.

**Day 5: Ali Bugyal to Patar Nachauni via Bedni Bugyal**

Yesterday was an ardous trek, but today we were promised that it would be a piece of cake. We started from Ali bugyal at around 8 am after watching sun rising behind the trishul mastiff. Just after reaching the steep top after 20 minutes, a magnificent view of himalayas was seen. In the blissful morning we saw peaks of Bandarpoonch, Mighty Chaukhumba, Hathi Parvat, Neelkanth on the left and Nanada ghunghti, Trishul on the right. Trishul felt so near that one jump and touch it. The view became more vivid as we reached bedni bugyal. Bedni is called one of the best meadows in Garhwal just for nothing. It offers delightful and amazing views of the peaks adding to its mythological relevance. We reached Ghoralautani and saw our campsites in Patharnacuhani. We reached there after a gradual descent. Pathar nachauni is a rocky place with lot of winds and changing climate. 

In Patharnachauni the fear of AMS struck to many, due to oxymeter readings, but actually it was mainly after seeing a guy on stretchers coming back from Bahguwabasa as the team went to acclamatize on a higher altitude in the evening. At the acclamatization point you magically get mobile signals and call your loved ones after 3-4 days. This was more of a motivation for us to go to the point as no-one wanted to climb more after the day's trek.

The Day ended with funny UNO games with 6 team mates in a tent of three. At night the sky was very clear and stars were so close that you can touch them. 



**Day 6: Patar Nachauni to Bhagwabasa via Kalu Vinayak**

We were told to keep only the essential stuff for the journey from here. In the higher altitutes even the weight of hankerchief can put one down. We started from Patharnachauni and faced a very zigzag and steep climb till Kalu Vinayak. In between the resting point one of our guide found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_sinensis"> "Keeda Jadi" </a> which has medicinal value and is very costly in the market. One kg of this costs anywhere between 5 to 8 lakhs. Ascedning up, the sound of councshell from kalu Vinayak became clearer. As we reached Kalu Vinayak we saw the seductive snow line at Bhaguwabasa and our final CampSite.
After and hour we reached bhaguabasha through the snow patches. Honestly the heart was filled with joy seeing myself admist such a fascinating atmosphere. Bored of Dal and Rice we had tea and omlette near the shop that claimed to be the last tea shop in India but it was not.

Later in the evening at around 3 pr 4 pm. The grey clouds overshadowed the sunlight and in a matter of few seconds it started snowfalling as if angels are having a pillow fight. The joy and happiness was visible in the cheer, as the ice flakes kissed our cheeks. After the snowfall our tents looked like blue beads in the clouds. The view was such hypnotizing that it was very hard to describe from where the snow had ended and clouds have started.

Later in the evening the evening we were provided crampons for walking in the ice till roopkund. Our next day's trek was on the mercy of weather.

**Day 7: bhagubasha to roopkund to patharnauchni**

We were told if the weather permits we will start the trek anytime between 3 or 4 am. I was unable to sleep due to the ectacsy of reaching the destination. From 9 am to 2 am I woke up around five times just to check the time. I heard the first whistle to get up for the trek at 2.32 am.
We lined up with our crampon boots and torches in our hands for the trek in the moonlit night. Few of us decided to stay back in Bhagwabasa. We were told that today is the most difficult day of the trek and indeed it was. Within our groups we were curious if we could go further from roopkund to junargali. After a few steps our crampons were filled with iceballs, which had to be removed . Trekking in snow becomes a lot tougher. After an hour or so the trail disaapeared and the guides and technical team with us had carrying ropes and axes created a trial in the snow. These guys had vast experience of the mountain and by running to and fro they made sure that no-one slips and falls into the valley. Huffing and puffing we made to the last few meters. These 500 meters were by by far the hardest. We joined hands on the little temple at the top and thanked godess Nanda for journey till here. Roopkund was situated beautifully between the moutain. The water in the lake has a thin sheet of ice. We were unable to locate any skeleton as the outskirts of the lake was surrounded by snow. Junargali looked achievable but soon the entire atmosphere we covered by fog and mist. So the trek leader dropped the plan. At roopkund we were served with Porridge which was bland but tasted heavenly. After quick surreal view of the surrounding and lots of pictures we started our descent. It was foggy and we are unable to see if our group lead is at front or back. In this confusion we made a quick descent and reached Baghwabasa quickly. Here I cheated a quick nap while waiting for others. The weather turned hostile as it started raining at the time of descend. After having lunch in the main tent we made the quick decent to Patharnacahuni in ponchos. We greeted luck to the travellers on the route going for the trek.
