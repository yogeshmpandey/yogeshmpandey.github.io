Kheerganga is probably the most famous trek in India after Triund. Almost everyone visiting Kasol, Manikaran and other places near Manali is very much tempted to do this trek. The trek is around 13 km long and has more than 2 ways to reach to the top. The main USP of this trek is the hot water springs at the end of the trek. Once you reach the top, all exhausted and tired, a quick swim in the springs in the middle of the towering peaks is very soothing and pleasurable.  

For us it was a weekend trek, we boarded our bus with the main reason for Kheerganga Trek. Had we have more time, we could have stayed a couple of days in Kasol.
We boarded our bus and reached Bhunter at around 7 am, from Bhunter we took a bus to Manikaran. Manikaran is a very famous Sikh pilgrim site. The buses from Manikaran are usually every 2 hours to Bhunter. So, we took a cab to reach Barshaini. From here we got our supplies and we started the trek.

We had an option to go via the village route which is easy and around 1 km less in length, but we took the route via Kalga village, which is a bit hard but is very beautiful as this trail is marked on a forest trail.

The path is well laid out and it is very hard to lose the path as there are clear markings on the trail. You will also find a lot of people doing this trek and a lot of small shops on the path to cater to the needs of the trekkers. Since there are a lot of waterfalls on the trek, there is no need to carry extra water.

>Sunset

We started at around 1 pm and reached the top at 6 pm, just in time to catch the beautiful sunset. The sun setting down beyond the cloud and snow-laden peaks look mesmerizing. Then we talked to one of the locals and got a tent at 300 per person. He also arranged campfire for us and we prepared our dinner.

Next morning after taking a lot of pictures and enjoying the serenity and calmness of the place we started our trek downhill.
