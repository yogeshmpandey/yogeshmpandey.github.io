Edit : Updated with some changes. 

Last year I got accepted in Georgia Tech's Online Version on MS called OMSCS. OMSCS provides 4 specializations. I plan to take the Machine Learning Specialization and following is the plan of courses I intend to take in this program. For Machine Learning Specialization, I need to complete 15 credits worth of courses in the Machine Learning Domain. 

There are 2 core courses available in OMSCS. (6 Credits) : 

- CS 7641 Machine Learning
- CS 6515 Introduction to Graduate Algorithms. 

I need to pick both of the above Courses. 

Then there are electives (9 Credits ) :

- CS 6476 Computer Vision
- CS 7642 Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (Formerly CS 8803-O03)
- CS 7643 Deep Learning 
- CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading
- CSE 6242 Data and Visual Analytics
- CSE 6250 Big Data for Health (Formerly CSE 8803)
- ISYE 6420 Bayesian Methods

I need to pick at least 3 from the above list of Courses. Rest I can pick from the open Courses.

The Plan I have is as follows:-


| Semester  | Course Type | Course Name | Remarks | Grade|Load|Hours Per Week|
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|------|---|
|Spring 2019|Other|HCI|Done |  A     |2.598|11.661|
|Summer 2019|Other|IIS| Done |  B     |2.382| 8.893 |
|Fall 2019|Other|CN|Done| A |2.479   |8.264|
|Spring 2020|Elective|**CV**|Done|  A | 4.024  |20.463|
|Summer 2020 |Elective|**KBAI**||- |3.5 |13.626|
|Fall 2020 |Elective|ML4T|| - |2.5|10  |
|Spring 2021|Core|Machine Learning| | - | 4.18 | 21|
|Summer 2021|Elective|**Ed-Tech**| |-|2.8|13.6|
|Fall 2021|Core | **Introduction to Graduate Algorithms**| |-|4.33|24.885|
|Spring 2022|Elective | Reinforcement Learning/**Big Data for Health**/**Deep Learning** | |-|>4|20.885|


With this plan, I cover all the necessary pre-requisites for an ML Specialization. It also covers the required pre-requisite in Interactive Intelligence. The subjects marked in bold are important. 
I hope I can get to the Courses with my time ticket.
