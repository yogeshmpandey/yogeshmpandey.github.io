Thanks to my job, this time, I landed in Vietnam. After completing the Work stuff, I planned to visit the city as usual. Ho Chi Minh is a big city, bigger than New York and London and has a high density of people living in it. The city walk was not planned in detail. I just started my walk from the backpacker's lane and stopped at the places that looked interesting.

My first stop was Ben-than  market. It was a little rainy outside, hence I stopped inside this tent market. There are a lot of different shops in the market. with average space no bigger than 3x3 meter. However, you can all sorts of things here. If you are good at haggling, then this is for you. I met a Sri-Lankan couple here. Who bargained the price of three coffee bags from 300k dong to 110k dongs. Sadly, since I lacked this talent, I just did window shopping and went towards my next destination.

My next destination was the War Remnants Museum. The Museum portrays the gory details of the Ani-American war in very brutal fashion. I saw tears in the eyes of the people who walked those lanes with me. The museum has a lot of memorabilia of the American planes, bombs and other instruments of mass destruction.

My next stop was the Central Post Office, Still Operational since the 18th century, this is French-style building made during the French colonial era. People can still send postcards to their loved ones from here. Nowadays a big portrait of Uncle Ho Chi Minh is kept in the walls.

Just Adjacent to the Central Post Office is the Notre Dame Cathedral. It is a French-built Catholic cathedral in the city centre.
It looked Magnificent with the statue of the Virgin Mary in the front. I spend some quiet time here and when the rain started, I started my way back to the Hotel.
