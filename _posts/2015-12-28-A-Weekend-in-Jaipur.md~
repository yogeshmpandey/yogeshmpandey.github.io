After a lot of boring weekends and as an escape to the chilling "Dilli ki Sardi", we made an escape to Capital city of Rajasthan. Our Plans were big but thanks to irctc, half of them went down the drain. However, lets forget that and focus on the good parts (Isn't that what life is all about !). So we started our journy on thrusday night to Jaipur and reached pretty early at around 6:00 am. The Temperate was so low that we started shivering and started searching for shelter. But since we planned to follow an itinerary, we filled the thermos with tea, hopped in an auto and reached Nahargarh Fort. As the Auto  got lost between the lanes we decided to start walking to the gate. Nahargarh is build on top of a hilltop and although it is not an Herculean task to climb that hill but still. With around 25 kg of backpack filled with neccesities, one has to break a sweat. We reached top and the entire city was looking as if it is covered with a warm white blanket. We sat on the topmost machan and watched the morning sun rising up from behind the hills clearing the fog from the city. It Felt Just Heavenly as we sipped warm tea from the Flask.

We stolled around the outskirts of the fort for around two hours and then went down. 

We then booked a jugnoo from there and went to Hawa Mahal. <Bried History>. We then headed to our hotel just to find out that our booking was not confirmed by the hotel. After cursing our luck and pledging never to use makemytrip app we moved to a different location and after 2-3 hours of wandering we finally found a hotel to check in. After resting we moved to explore the city on feets. Covering Rajmandir, Statue Circle, Birla Planeterium, Taj Rambagh Palace.

Then we Reached Birla Temple and Ganesha temple. The temples were good. The thing that stands out is the dimly lit palace that stans behind the birla mandir. Since it was Christmas and obviously a full moon night. The view of the fort with a Crystal moon in the backgound was like a recap of GOT episodes. After sitting on the side walk of the temple we went back to the hotel.


Next day we took an auto to city place. The Auto guy was fun, narrating various stories about the city and his times he told us to visit Albert Hall. After City palace he dropped us at Albert Hall Museum. The museum has the soul of the city, its culture and its grand lineage. One intersting thing about this place is that it houses many pegions like too many. I ahve never seen this many pegions in my life before. The Museum has variety of interesting things including a mummy. After this we went back to hotel as we needed to check out. After checking out we went to the magnificient raj mandir and experienced Bajiro Mastani there. Everyone should must once in a lifetime watch a flick here. Its Mermerising.

It was 4am and we were already late for Amer Fort. Took a local city bus and Went to Amer. After struggling with the traffic at the heart of the city we reached JAl MAhal. 


From there we took an auto to Amer fort . The sun was alrady beneth the horizon as we reached amer. We reached the top and then rushed back down to get the tickets to the Light and Sound show, but to our bad luck the show was already house full. Then we sat on the stairs to the lake near the parking and watched the show from there. Totally free with a better view.


Later in the night went to the train station to catch our train to jodhpur but it was alrady late by 4 hours. Disappointed we booked a bus back to Gurgaon. Another Day Jodhpur :)

After a nostalgic meet and discussion of college life and afterwards on Saturday, we decided to start our journey on Sunday's morning. Next day from MG Road Metro Station we reached Khan Market metro Station. These places are at a walking distance from one other. But One should know in what order he should go, else he/she would be covering double the distance on foot like we did.

**Purana Qila**
 
After Reaching Khan Market, we followed the GPS and reached Purana Qila. The Qila is one of the oldest forts in Delhi. Some people say that the remains have existed from the days Pandavas created Indraprastha. Later Sher Shah Suri created a city around the Qila. Inside the Qila, there is a Kunti Temple and probably 2 mosques. It also has the famous Humayun's Library from where he fell to death.

**National Zoo**

National Zoo is right in front of the Khairul Manzil Mosque of Purana Qila. We decided to visit the zoo. But there was too  much crowd that made us rethink the plan. After having a heavy Brunch at the zoo canteen, we went to visit Humayun's Tomb.

**Humayun's Tomb**

Humayun's Tomb is a marvel of Architecture and Proportions. It is set in a geometrically arranged garden crisscrossed by water channels representing a paradise. Beautiful Cravings on the gates and Tile Work on the dome is just Magnificent. The Way it is built shows the hint of motivation for Taj Mahal, Which has similar proportions as Humayun's Tomb. The Tomb is very well maintained by ASI. In the future, a museum is to be built around the Tomb.

**Lodhi Gardens**

Lodhi Gardens are a hotspot for the elite Delhiets for Morning/Evening walks. Apart from its astonishing ecosystem it houses various tombs and domes from Lodhi Dynasty. Now one can see people training for marathons doing CrossFit here.

**Hazrath Nizamuddin Dargah**

At a few foots is the is the dargah of one of the world's most famous Sufi saints, Nizamuddin Auliya. We paid the visit and then went from one spiritual experience to another in the lotus temple.

**Lotus Temple**

The design of lotus Temple is inspired by... Well, Lotus Flower. But what is more, intriguing than its spectacular Architecture is the faith associated with it. The Lotus Temple is a Bahá'í House of Worship. Bahá’í Faith, hold its foundation on the Oneness of God, the Oneness of Religions, and the Oneness of Mankind. In the Bahá’í philosophy humanity is understood to be in a process of collective evolution. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progression from age to age. Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend. Hits straight in the Atheist/Agonist Mind. Right?
